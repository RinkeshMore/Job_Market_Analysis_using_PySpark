# Job_Market_Analysis_using_PySpark
This project aims to do Job Market Analysis on Dataset of 61000 rows which we extracted from www.naukri.com using Octoparse tool. Our Project's goal is to predict maximum and minimum salary for a particular job title based on Minimum and Maximum Experience and Job Title in the Industry. For this we preprocessed the 26 datasets(for 26 different Job Titles) using Numpy and Pandas. We then merged these 26 csv files into a single csv through a python code. We then put this file in Apache Spark where we established a Spark Session for removing outliers(using std. dev.) from our Predictor fields and then encoding those fields which have categorical entries in them through PySpark. We then applied Machine Learning models (Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor) on our dataset. We Evaluated our model through Regression evaluation metrics(MAE,RMSE,R2 & Adjusted R2). Made dashboards to visualize the job market scenario using Tableau.
